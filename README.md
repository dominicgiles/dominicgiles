👋 Hi, I’m [Dominic Giles](https://github.com/dominicgiles). I am based in London, UK. I am a medical student and PhD researcher at University College London as a candidate on the [MBPhD](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mbphd/) and [UKRI CDT for AI-Enabled Healthcare](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/aihealth-cdt/) programmes, dual funded by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org) and [UCLH BRC](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/content/biomedical-research-centre). I have a First Class BSc (Hons) in Medical Science with Medical Physics and Bioengineering, and a distinction in MRes Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Healthcare. I am working towards receiving my PhD and MBBS primary medical qualification by the end of 2025.

👀 I’m interested in using applying artificial intelligence to transform healthcare and ultimately result in better patient outcomes.

🧠 My current main research focus involves using counterfactual modelling to predict individualised susceptibility to stroke treatments.

🌱 I am very proficient with Python including standard data science libraries including extensive use of Gaussian processes and machine learning models such as SVMs. I use Linux environments with git version control and LaTeX for writing. I am currently working on using GPU-accelerated deep learning.

🎹 Amateur concert pianist. Working towards my LTCL diploma in performance, with a programme of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin.

💞️ I am open to collaborations in the fields of computational neuroscience/psychiatry, artificial intelligence, data science, mathematics and medical education.
